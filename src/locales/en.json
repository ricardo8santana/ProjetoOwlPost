With this in mind, we decided to create a game. Using the idea of ​​gamification, we are committed to developing a game that makes learning complex content easier and more fun.",

That's how the idea of ​​bringing all this content to one place came about. Teachers and students share content that they know and that would be spread out in books, or websites and other students can access this content.",
